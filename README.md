# Three.js and WebGL 3D Journey

Welcome to the repository for your Three.js and WebGL 3D journey! This repository is designed to guide you through the process of learning and mastering Three.js and WebGL, enabling you to create stunning 3D web experiences. Whether you're a beginner or have some prior experience, this course will help you develop your skills and understanding of 3D graphics on the web.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several sections, each covering different aspects of Three.js and WebGL. The repository contains code examples, exercises, and project files corresponding to each section. The structure of the repository is as follows:
```
/
|-- section-1/
| |-- code/
| |-- exercises/
| |-- projects/
|-- section-2/
| |-- code/
| |-- exercises/
| |-- projects/
|-- section-3/
| |-- code/
| |-- exercises/
| |-- projects/
|-- ...
|-- section-n/
| |-- code/
| |-- exercises/
| |-- projects/
|-- README.md
|-- LICENSE
```


Each section folder (`section-1`, `section-2`, etc.) contains three subfolders: `code`, `exercises`, and `projects`. The `code` folder contains the code examples discussed in the section's lessons. The `exercises` folder contains exercises that will test your understanding and allow you to practice what you've learned. The `projects` folder contains project files for larger-scale applications or demonstrations.

## Getting Started

To begin your Three.js and WebGL 3D journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-webgl-journey.git



2. Navigate to the root folder of the repository:
cd threejs-webgl-journey



3. Each section folder contains its own set of instructions and resources. Start with the first section by navigating to its directory:
cd section-1



4. Explore the `code` folder within the section, where you'll find code examples and demonstrations. Study the code, run the examples, and experiment with different parameters.

5. Move on to the `exercises` folder and attempt the exercises provided. These exercises will reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in the section. Refer to the code examples and the documentation as needed.

6. Once you feel comfortable with the section's material, you can proceed to the `projects` folder. These projects will allow you to apply your knowledge in a more practical manner. Modify and enhance the provided project files or create your own projects from scratch.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each section, gradually advancing your skills and understanding of Three.js and WebGL.
