Three.js and WebGL 3D Journey
Welcome to the repository for your Three.js and WebGL 3D journey! This repository is designed to guide you through the process of learning and mastering Three.js and WebGL, enabling you to create stunning 3D web experiences. Whether you're a beginner or have some prior experience, this course will help you develop your skills and understanding of 3D graphics on the web.

Course Structure
The course is divided into several sections, each covering different aspects of Three.js and WebGL. The repository contains code examples, exercises, and project files corresponding to each section. The structure of the repository is as follows:


/
|-- section-1/
|   |-- code/
|   |-- exercises/
|   |-- projects/
|-- section-2/
|   |-- code/
|   |-- exercises/
|   |-- projects/
|-- section-3/
|   |-- code/

|-- section-n/
|   |-- code/
|   |-- exercises/
|   |-- projects/
|-- README.md
|-- LICENSE
Each section folder (section-1, section-2, etc.) contains three subfolders: code, exercises, and projects. The code folder contains the code examples discussed in the section's lessons. The exercises folder contains exercises that will test your understanding and allow you to practice what you've learned. The projects folder contains project files for larger-scale applications or demonstrations.

Getting Started
To begin your Three.js and WebGL 3D journey, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-webgl-journey.git
Navigate to the root folder of the repository:

bash
Copy code
cd threejs-webgl-journey
Each section folder contains its own set of instructions and resources. Start with the first section by navigating to its directory:

bash
Copy code
cd section-1
Explore the code folder within the section, where you'll find code examples and demonstrations. Study the code, run the examples, and experiment with different parameters.

Move on to the exercises folder and attempt the exercises provided. These exercises will reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in the section. Refer to the code examples and the documentation as needed.

Once you feel comfortable with the section's material, you can proceed to the projects folder. These projects will allow you to apply your knowledge in a more practical manner. Modify and enhance the provided project files or create your own projects from scratch.

Repeat steps 3-6 for each section, gradually advancing your skills and understanding of Three.js and WebGL.
